# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
   Software engineering is a systematic approach to software development using engineering principles to the design, develop, test, deploy and maintain a software product.
   It's importance in tech industry cause;
           1. Innovation and competiveness- best and faster engineerig principles enable companies to stay a head and have a competitive egde towards their rivals.
           2. User Fulfillment to a software product-better SE principles enable much satisfaction from the users hence the love and more usage of the product.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. Introduction of structured programming- due to software crisis in the 60s, softwares were unmanageble and prone to errors cause of it's complexity, thus allowing softwares to broken 
     down into small structures to be managed in phases or modules enabling faster and efficient way to build and deploy codes.
  2. Introduction of OOP methodologies in the 80s, OOP emphasizes four main principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. OOP revolutionized software design by 
     promoting reusability, modularity, and scalability.
  3. Rise of Agile Methodologies from 2000s to present day, Agile emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility in responding to changing requirements. Agile  
     transformed software engineering by making development more adaptive and customer-focused. This approach has become the industry standard, particularly in environments where rapid  
     change and innovation are critical.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
